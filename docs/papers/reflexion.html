    <div class="description" data-step="0">This is the sample question from the <a target="_blank" href="https://hotpotqa.github.io">HotpotQA dataset</a> which was used to evaluate Reflexion prompting on question answering tasks.</div>
    <div class="description" data-step="1">The Actor prompt follows the same format as <a href="react.html">ReAct</a> prompting.</div>
    <div class="description tool" data-step="2">Each tool definition shows how to call the tool and describes when that tool should be used. This is how the model decides which tool to use to answer the input question.</div>
    <div class="description" data-step="3">This part of the prompt is slightly different from the standard ReAct prompt. It is only in the GitHub repo and not covered in the paper.</div>
    <div class="description" data-step="4">The Reflexion few-shot examples are slightly longer than the ReAct examples because they include a self-reflection step.</div>
    <div class="description" data-step="5">The input question is placed at the end of the prompt to begin the next cycle of Thought, Action, Observation steps.</div>
    <div class="description" data-step="6">Here we see that the model has read the question and decided to call <span class="tool">Search[Grown-Ups]</span> to find out who starred in the TV show.</div>
    <div class="description tool" data-step="7">The <span class="tool">Search[]</span> tool takes a single text argument and searches Wikipedia for that term. The tool returns the first 5 sentences of text from the first matching result.</div>
    <div class="description tool" data-step="8">Here we can see the first 5 sentences of the Wikipedia page for <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grown-Ups">Grown-Ups</a>.</div>
    <div class="description" data-step="9">just like in <a href="react.html">ReAct</a> prompting, the outputs from the previous cycle get added to the end of the prompt as a form of short-term memory. This is what enables the model to reflect on the outputs of the previous action and use that information when it decides on the next action to take.</div>
    <div class="description" data-step="10">
        <p>Recall in <em>Thought 1</em>, the model decided that it needed to call both <span class="tool">Search[Grown-Ups]</span> and <span class="tool">Search["’Allo ’Allo!"]</span> to find which actor they have in common. However, since the ReAct prompting follows a strict Through, Action, Observation cycle, it can only run one tool per cycle.</p>
        <p>Now we see the follow-up cycle where the model has remembered the previous thought and is continuing it's original plan by calling <span class="tool">Search["’Allo ’Allo!"]</span>.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="description tool" data-step="11">
        <p>The page cannot be found because the call to the tool wasn't formatted correctly. The quotation marks around "’Allo ’Allo!" should not have been included in the <span class="tool">Search</span> call.</p>
        <p>This is a good example of how brittle the Action syntax can be and the model can easily get confused by things like quotation marks in the original question.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="description" data-step="12">To recover from the previous error, the model chooses to <span class="tool">Search[Gorden Kaye]</span> from the list of similar pages in <em>Observation 2</em></div>
    <div class="description tool" data-step="13">Here we can see the first 5 sentences of the Wikipedia page for <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gorden_Kaye">Gorden Kaye</a>.</div>
    <div class="description tool" data-step="14">The model decides that it has found the answer to the original input question and end the prompting cycle by calling <span class="tool">Finish[Rene Artois]</span>.</div>
    <div class="description tool" data-step="15">However, unlike in the <a href="react.html">ReAct</a> example, the prompting doesn't end here. The <span class="tool">Finish</span> tool is able to look up the correct answer from the evaluation dataset and add the result to the prompt cycle; letting the model know that it's answer is "INCORRECT".</div>
    <div class="description" data-step="16">The Self-Reflection prompt is the major difference between Reflexion and <a href="react.html">ReAct</a>. This is where the model is asked to look at the full trajectory of prompts so far and diagnose the possible reason for why the previous answer was unsuccessful.</div>
    <div class="description" data-step="17">The few-shot examples are the same as in the Actor prompt. They both contain examples of self-reflection.</div>
    <div class="description" data-step="18">The previous trial is annotated as such and the "Reflection:" prompt is added to make sure that the model writes a reflection and doesn't get confused and try to jump right back into the Though, Action, Observation cycle.</div>
    <div class="description" data-step="19">The self-reflection accurately catches the bad tool call in the previous set of prompts but still doesn't know that Gorden Kaye only appeared on "’Allo ’Allo!" and not on Grown-Ups.</div>
    <div class="description" data-step="20">
        <p>The reflection is now added to a new section of the Actor prompt. If there are many attempts to solve the question, the full list of self-reflections will appear in order here; giving the model a high-level summary of why it's attempts have failed.</p>
        <p>Note that the "short-term memory" scratchpad has been reset so the model no can no longer see the specific steps it took in the previous trials. It can only see the reflections.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="description" data-step="21">We can immediately see the effects of the actor prompt reseting it's scratchpad because it starts the 2nd trial by taking the exact same <span class="tool">Search[Grown-Ups]</span> action that it took at the start of the first trial. If the scratchpad hadn't been reset, the model could have re-used the previous tool response and just picked up where it left off.</div>
    <div class="description" data-step="22">
        <p>This time the model correctly realizes that the Grown-Ups page doesn't say which actor was best-known for a role on "’Allo ’Allo!" and so it changes its approach and starts looking up the actors in Grown-Up to see if any of them starred in "’Allo ’Allo!". </p>
        <p>Even though it started with the same action as the first trial, the model was able to change it's trajectory on the 2nd trial because the reflection has been added to the Actor prompt.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="description tool" data-step="23">The Wikipedia page for <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_Kelly">Sam Kelly</a> shows that one of the roles that he is best-known for was on "’Allo ’Allo!".</div>
    <div class="description tool" data-step="24">The model concludes it's second trial by calling <span class="tool">Finish[Captain Hans Geering]</span>.</div>
    <div class="description tool" data-step="25">The answer is validated and found to be correct!</div>

                <em>Previous Trial:</em><br/>
                <em>Question:</em> The Rome Protocols were signed by three Prime Ministers one of which was assassinated as part of what?<br/>
                <em>Thought 1:</em> I need to search Rome Protocols, find the three Prime Ministers, then find what they were assassinated as part of.<br/>
                <em>Action 1:</em> <span class="tool">Search[Rome Protocols]</span><br/>
                <em>Observation 1:</em> The Rome Protocols were a series of three international agreements concluded in Rome on 17 March 1934 between the governments of Austria, Hungary and Italy. They were signed by Italian Prime Minister Benito Mussolini, Austrian Chancellor Engelbert Dollfuss and Hungarian Prime Minister Gyula Gömbös. All of the protocols went into effect on 12 July 1934 and were registered in League of Nations Treaty Series on 12 December 1934.<br/>
                <em>Thought 2:</em> The three Prime Ministers were Benito Mussolini, Engelbert Dollfuss, and Gyula Gömbös. I need to search Benito Mussolini and find what he was assassinated as part of.<br/>
                <em>Action 2:</em> <span class="tool">Search[Benito Mussolini]</span><br/>
                <em>Observation 2:</em> Benito Amilcare Andrea Mussolini (UK:  MU(U)SS-ə-LEE-nee, US:  MOOSS-, Italian: [beˈniːto aˈmilkare anˈdrɛːa mussoˈliːni]; 29 July 1883 – 28 April 1945) was an Italian politician and journalist who founded and led the National Fascist Party (PNF). He was Prime Minister of Italy from the March on Rome in 1922 until his deposition in 1943, as well as "Duce" of Italian fascism from the establishment of the Italian Fasces of Combat in 1919 until his summary execution in 1945 by Italian partisans. As dictator of Italy and principal founder of fascism, Mussolini inspired and supported the international spread of fascist movements during the inter-war period.Mussolini was originally a socialist politician and a journalist at the Avanti! newspaper. In 1912, he became a member of the National Directorate of the Italian Socialist Party (PSI), but he was expelled from the PSI for advocating military intervention in World War I, in opposition to the party's stance on neutrality. In 1914, Mussolini founded a new journal, Il Popolo d'Italia, and served in the Royal Italian Army during the war until he was wounded and discharged in 1917. Mussolini denounced the PSI, his views now centering on Italian nationalism instead of socialism, and later founded the fascist movement which came to oppose egalitarianism and class conflict, instead advocating "revolutionary nationalism" transcending class lines. On 31 October 1922, following the March on Rome (28–30 October), Mussolini was appointed prime minister by King Victor Emmanuel III, becoming the youngest individual to hold the office up to that time. After removing all political opposition through his secret police and outlawing labor strikes, Mussolini and his followers consolidated power through a series of laws that transformed the nation into a one-party dictatorship. Within five years, Mussolini had established dictatorial authority by both legal and illegal means and aspired to create a totalitarian state. In 1929, Mussolini signed the Lateran Treaty with the Holy See to establish Vatican City.<br/>
                Mussolini's foreign policy aimed to restore the ancient grandeur of the Roman Empire by expanding Italian colonial possessions and the fascist sphere of influence. In the 1920s, he ordered the Pacification of Libya, instructed the bombing of Corfu over an incident with Greece, established a protectorate over Albania, and incorporated the city of Fiume into the Italian state via agreements with Yugoslavia. In 1936, Ethiopia was conquered following the Second Italo-Ethiopian War and merged into Italian East Africa (AOI) with Eritrea and Somalia. In 1939, Italian forces annexed Albania. Between 1936 and 1939, Mussolini ordered the successful Italian military intervention in Spain in favor of Francisco Franco during the Spanish Civil War. Mussolini's Italy initially tried to avoid the outbreak of a second global war, sending troops at the Brenner Pass to delay Anschluss and taking part in the Stresa Front, the Lytton Report, the Treaty of Lausanne, the Four-Power Pact and the Munich Agreement. However, Italy then alienated itself from Britain and France by aligning with Germany and Japan. Germany invaded Poland on 1 September 1939, resulting in declarations of war by France and the UK and the start of World War II.<br/>
                On 10 June 1940, Mussolini decided to enter the war on the Axis side. Despite initial success, the subsequent Axis collapse on multiple fronts and eventual Allied invasion of Sicily made Mussolini lose the support of the population and members of the Fascist Party. As a consequence, early on 25 July 1943, the Grand Council of Fascism passed a motion of no confidence in Mussolini; later that day King Victor Emmanuel III dismissed him as head of government and had him placed in custody, appointing Pietro Badoglio to succeed him as Prime Minister. After the king agreed to an armistice with the Allies, on 12 September 1943 Mussolini was rescued from captivity in the Gran Sasso raid by German paratroopers and Waffen-SS commandos led by Major Otto-Harald Mors. Adolf Hitler, after meeting with the rescued former dictator, then put Mussolini in charge of a puppet regime in northern Italy, the Italian Social Republic (Italian: Repubblica Sociale Italiana, RSI), informally known as the Salò Republic, causing a civil war. In late April 1945, in the wake of near total defeat, Mussolini and his mistress Clara Petacci attempted to flee to Switzerland, but both were captured by Italian communist partisans and summarily executed by firing squad on 28 April 1945 near Lake Como. The bodies of Mussolini and his mistress were then taken to Milan, where they were hung upside down at a service station to publicly confirm their demise.<br/>
                <em>Thought 3:</em> Benito Mussolini was assassinated as part of the collapse of the Axis powers during World War II. So the Rome Protocols were signed by three Prime Ministers one of which was assassinated as part of World War II.<br/>

            <em>Action 2:</em> <span class="tool">Search[Benito Mussolini]</span><br/>
            <em>Observation 2:</em> Benito Amilcare Andrea Mussolini (UK:  MU(U)SS-ə-LEE-nee, US:  MOOSS-, Italian: [beˈniːto aˈmilkare anˈdrɛːa mussoˈliːni]; 29 July 1883 – 28 April 1945) was an Italian politician and journalist who founded and led the National Fascist Party (PNF). He was Prime Minister of Italy from the March on Rome in 1922 until his deposition in 1943, as well as "Duce" of Italian fascism from the establishment of the Italian Fasces of Combat in 1919 until his summary execution in 1945 by Italian partisans. As dictator of Italy and principal founder of fascism, Mussolini inspired and supported the international spread of fascist movements during the inter-war period.Mussolini was originally a socialist politician and a journalist at the Avanti! newspaper. In 1912, he became a member of the National Directorate of the Italian Socialist Party (PSI), but he was expelled from the PSI for advocating military intervention in World War I, in opposition to the party's stance on neutrality. In 1914, Mussolini founded a new journal, Il Popolo d'Italia, and served in the Royal Italian Army during the war until he was wounded and discharged in 1917. Mussolini denounced the PSI, his views now centering on Italian nationalism instead of socialism, and later founded the fascist movement which came to oppose egalitarianism and class conflict, instead advocating "revolutionary nationalism" transcending class lines. On 31 October 1922, following the March on Rome (28–30 October), Mussolini was appointed prime minister by King Victor Emmanuel III, becoming the youngest individual to hold the office up to that time. After removing all political opposition through his secret police and outlawing labor strikes, Mussolini and his followers consolidated power through a series of laws that transformed the nation into a one-party dictatorship. Within five years, Mussolini had established dictatorial authority by both legal and illegal means and aspired to create a totalitarian state. In 1929, Mussolini signed the Lateran Treaty with the Holy See to establish Vatican City.<br/>
            Mussolini's foreign policy aimed to restore the ancient grandeur of the Roman Empire by expanding Italian colonial possessions and the fascist sphere of influence. In the 1920s, he ordered the Pacification of Libya, instructed the bombing of Corfu over an incident with Greece, established a protectorate over Albania, and incorporated the city of Fiume into the Italian state via agreements with Yugoslavia. In 1936, Ethiopia was conquered following the Second Italo-Ethiopian War and merged into Italian East Africa (AOI) with Eritrea and Somalia. In 1939, Italian forces annexed Albania. Between 1936 and 1939, Mussolini ordered the successful Italian military intervention in Spain in favor of Francisco Franco during the Spanish Civil War. Mussolini's Italy initially tried to avoid the outbreak of a second global war, sending troops at the Brenner Pass to delay Anschluss and taking part in the Stresa Front, the Lytton Report, the Treaty of Lausanne, the Four-Power Pact and the Munich Agreement. However, Italy then alienated itself from Britain and France by aligning with Germany and Japan. Germany invaded Poland on 1 September 1939, resulting in declarations of war by France and the UK and the start of World War II.<br/>
            On 10 June 1940, Mussolini decided to enter the war on the Axis side. Despite initial success, the subsequent Axis collapse on multiple fronts and eventual Allied invasion of Sicily made Mussolini lose the support of the population and members of the Fascist Party. As a consequence, early on 25 July 1943, the Grand Council of Fascism passed a motion of no confidence in Mussolini; later that day King Victor Emmanuel III dismissed him as head of government and had him placed in custody, appointing Pietro Badoglio to succeed him as Prime Minister. After the king agreed to an armistice with the Allies, on 12 September 1943 Mussolini was rescued from captivity in the Gran Sasso raid by German paratroopers and Waffen-SS commandos led by Major Otto-Harald Mors. Adolf Hitler, after meeting with the rescued former dictator, then put Mussolini in charge of a puppet regime in northern Italy, the Italian Social Republic (Italian: Repubblica Sociale Italiana, RSI), informally known as the Salò Republic, causing a civil war. In late April 1945, in the wake of near total defeat, Mussolini and his mistress Clara Petacci attempted to flee to Switzerland, but both were captured by Italian communist partisans and summarily executed by firing squad on 28 April 1945 near Lake Como. The bodies of Mussolini and his mistress were then taken to Milan, where they were hung upside down at a service station to publicly confirm their demise.<br/>
            <em>Thought 3:</em> Benito Mussolini was assassinated as part of the collapse of the Axis powers during World War II. So the Rome Protocols were signed by three Prime Ministers one of which was assassinated as part of World War II.<br/>

            <em>Previous Trial:</em><br/>
            <em>Question:</em> The Rome Protocols were signed by three Prime Ministers one of which was assassinated as part of what?<br/>
            <em>Thought 1:</em> I need to search Rome Protocols, find the three Prime Ministers, then find what they were assassinated as part of.<br/>
            <em>Action 1:</em> <span class="tool">Search[Rome Protocols]</span><br/>
            <em>Observation 1:</em> The Rome Protocols were a series of three international agreements concluded in Rome on 17 March 1934 between the governments of Austria, Hungary and Italy. They were signed by Italian Prime Minister Benito Mussolini, Austrian Chancellor Engelbert Dollfuss and Hungarian Prime Minister Gyula Gömbös. All of the protocols went into effect on 12 July 1934 and were registered in League of Nations Treaty Series on 12 December 1934.<br/>
            <em>Thought 2:</em> The three Prime Ministers were Benito Mussolini, Engelbert Dollfuss, and Gyula Gömbös. I need to search Benito Mussolini and find what he was assassinated as part of.<br/>
            <em>Action 2:</em> <span class="tool">Search[Benito Mussolini]</span><br/>
            <em>Observation 2:</em> Benito Amilcare Andrea Mussolini (UK:  MU(U)SS-ə-LEE-nee, US:  MOOSS-, Italian: [beˈniːto aˈmilkare anˈdrɛːa mussoˈliːni]; 29 July 1883 – 28 April 1945) was an Italian politician and journalist who founded and led the National Fascist Party (PNF). He was Prime Minister of Italy from the March on Rome in 1922 until his deposition in 1943, as well as "Duce" of Italian fascism from the establishment of the Italian Fasces of Combat in 1919 until his summary execution in 1945 by Italian partisans. As dictator of Italy and principal founder of fascism, Mussolini inspired and supported the international spread of fascist movements during the inter-war period.Mussolini was originally a socialist politician and a journalist at the Avanti! newspaper. In 1912, he became a member of the National Directorate of the Italian Socialist Party (PSI), but he was expelled from the PSI for advocating military intervention in World War I, in opposition to the party's stance on neutrality. In 1914, Mussolini founded a new journal, Il Popolo d'Italia, and served in the Royal Italian Army during the war until he was wounded and discharged in 1917. Mussolini denounced the PSI, his views now centering on Italian nationalism instead of socialism, and later founded the fascist movement which came to oppose egalitarianism and class conflict, instead advocating "revolutionary nationalism" transcending class lines. On 31 October 1922, following the March on Rome (28–30 October), Mussolini was appointed prime minister by King Victor Emmanuel III, becoming the youngest individual to hold the office up to that time. After removing all political opposition through his secret police and outlawing labor strikes, Mussolini and his followers consolidated power through a series of laws that transformed the nation into a one-party dictatorship. Within five years, Mussolini had established dictatorial authority by both legal and illegal means and aspired to create a totalitarian state. In 1929, Mussolini signed the Lateran Treaty with the Holy See to establish Vatican City.<br/>
            Mussolini's foreign policy aimed to restore the ancient grandeur of the Roman Empire by expanding Italian colonial possessions and the fascist sphere of influence. In the 1920s, he ordered the Pacification of Libya, instructed the bombing of Corfu over an incident with Greece, established a protectorate over Albania, and incorporated the city of Fiume into the Italian state via agreements with Yugoslavia. In 1936, Ethiopia was conquered following the Second Italo-Ethiopian War and merged into Italian East Africa (AOI) with Eritrea and Somalia. In 1939, Italian forces annexed Albania. Between 1936 and 1939, Mussolini ordered the successful Italian military intervention in Spain in favor of Francisco Franco during the Spanish Civil War. Mussolini's Italy initially tried to avoid the outbreak of a second global war, sending troops at the Brenner Pass to delay Anschluss and taking part in the Stresa Front, the Lytton Report, the Treaty of Lausanne, the Four-Power Pact and the Munich Agreement. However, Italy then alienated itself from Britain and France by aligning with Germany and Japan. Germany invaded Poland on 1 September 1939, resulting in declarations of war by France and the UK and the start of World War II.<br/>
            On 10 June 1940, Mussolini decided to enter the war on the Axis side. Despite initial success, the subsequent Axis collapse on multiple fronts and eventual Allied invasion of Sicily made Mussolini lose the support of the population and members of the Fascist Party. As a consequence, early on 25 July 1943, the Grand Council of Fascism passed a motion of no confidence in Mussolini; later that day King Victor Emmanuel III dismissed him as head of government and had him placed in custody, appointing Pietro Badoglio to succeed him as Prime Minister. After the king agreed to an armistice with the Allies, on 12 September 1943 Mussolini was rescued from captivity in the Gran Sasso raid by German paratroopers and Waffen-SS commandos led by Major Otto-Harald Mors. Adolf Hitler, after meeting with the rescued former dictator, then put Mussolini in charge of a puppet regime in northern Italy, the Italian Social Republic (Italian: Repubblica Sociale Italiana, RSI), informally known as the Salò Republic, causing a civil war. In late April 1945, in the wake of near total defeat, Mussolini and his mistress Clara Petacci attempted to flee to Switzerland, but both were captured by Italian communist partisans and summarily executed by firing squad on 28 April 1945 near Lake Como. The bodies of Mussolini and his mistress were then taken to Milan, where they were hung upside down at a service station to publicly confirm their demise.<br/>
            <em>Thought 3:</em> Benito Mussolini was assassinated as part of the collapse of the Axis powers during World War II. So the Rome Protocols were signed by three Prime Ministers one of which was assassinated as part of World War II.<br/>

            <em>Reflection:</em> I searched one of the prime ministers involved in the signing, then attemted to answer right away. I should have searched each of the prime ministers, then looked up 'death' on each of their pages in order to get more information before answering.

                <em>Question:</em> The Rome Protocols were signed by three Prime Ministers one of which was assassinated as part of what?<br/>
                <em>Thought 1:</em> I need to search Rome Protocols, find the three Prime Ministers, then find what they were assassinated as part of.<br/>
                <em>Action 1:</em> <span class="tool">Search[Rome Protocols]</span><br/>
                <em>Observation 1:</em> The Rome Protocols were a series of three international agreements concluded in Rome on 17 March 1934 between the governments of Austria, Hungary and Italy. They were signed by Italian Prime Minister Benito Mussolini, Austrian Chancellor Engelbert Dollfuss and Hungarian Prime Minister Gyula Gömbös. All of the protocols went into effect on 12 July 1934 and were registered in League of Nations Treaty Series on 12 December 1934.<br/>
                <em>Thought 2:</em> The three Prime Ministers were Benito Mussolini, Engelbert Dollfuss, and Gyula Gömbös. I need to search Benito Mussolini and find what he was assassinated as part of.<br/>
                <em>Action 2:</em> <span class="tool">Search[Benito Mussolini]</span><br/>
                <em>Observation 2:</em> Benito Amilcare Andrea Mussolini (UK:  MU(U)SS-ə-LEE-nee, US:  MOOSS-, Italian: [beˈniːto aˈmilkare anˈdrɛːa mussoˈliːni]; 29 July 1883 – 28 April 1945) was an Italian politician and journalist who founded and led the National Fascist Party (PNF). He was Prime Minister of Italy from the March on Rome in 1922 until his deposition in 1943, as well as "Duce" of Italian fascism from the establishment of the Italian Fasces of Combat in 1919 until his summary execution in 1945 by Italian partisans. As dictator of Italy and principal founder of fascism, Mussolini inspired and supported the international spread of fascist movements during the inter-war period.Mussolini was originally a socialist politician and a journalist at the Avanti! newspaper. In 1912, he became a member of the National Directorate of the Italian Socialist Party (PSI), but he was expelled from the PSI for advocating military intervention in World War I, in opposition to the party's stance on neutrality. In 1914, Mussolini founded a new journal, Il Popolo d'Italia, and served in the Royal Italian Army during the war until he was wounded and discharged in 1917. Mussolini denounced the PSI, his views now centering on Italian nationalism instead of socialism, and later founded the fascist movement which came to oppose egalitarianism and class conflict, instead advocating "revolutionary nationalism" transcending class lines. On 31 October 1922, following the March on Rome (28–30 October), Mussolini was appointed prime minister by King Victor Emmanuel III, becoming the youngest individual to hold the office up to that time. After removing all political opposition through his secret police and outlawing labor strikes, Mussolini and his followers consolidated power through a series of laws that transformed the nation into a one-party dictatorship. Within five years, Mussolini had established dictatorial authority by both legal and illegal means and aspired to create a totalitarian state. In 1929, Mussolini signed the Lateran Treaty with the Holy See to establish Vatican City.<br/>
                Mussolini's foreign policy aimed to restore the ancient grandeur of the Roman Empire by expanding Italian colonial possessions and the fascist sphere of influence. In the 1920s, he ordered the Pacification of Libya, instructed the bombing of Corfu over an incident with Greece, established a protectorate over Albania, and incorporated the city of Fiume into the Italian state via agreements with Yugoslavia. In 1936, Ethiopia was conquered following the Second Italo-Ethiopian War and merged into Italian East Africa (AOI) with Eritrea and Somalia. In 1939, Italian forces annexed Albania. Between 1936 and 1939, Mussolini ordered the successful Italian military intervention in Spain in favor of Francisco Franco during the Spanish Civil War. Mussolini's Italy initially tried to avoid the outbreak of a second global war, sending troops at the Brenner Pass to delay Anschluss and taking part in the Stresa Front, the Lytton Report, the Treaty of Lausanne, the Four-Power Pact and the Munich Agreement. However, Italy then alienated itself from Britain and France by aligning with Germany and Japan. Germany invaded Poland on 1 September 1939, resulting in declarations of war by France and the UK and the start of World War II.<br/>
                On 10 June 1940, Mussolini decided to enter the war on the Axis side. Despite initial success, the subsequent Axis collapse on multiple fronts and eventual Allied invasion of Sicily made Mussolini lose the support of the population and members of the Fascist Party. As a consequence, early on 25 July 1943, the Grand Council of Fascism passed a motion of no confidence in Mussolini; later that day King Victor Emmanuel III dismissed him as head of government and had him placed in custody, appointing Pietro Badoglio to succeed him as Prime Minister. After the king agreed to an armistice with the Allies, on 12 September 1943 Mussolini was rescued from captivity in the Gran Sasso raid by German paratroopers and Waffen-SS commandos led by Major Otto-Harald Mors. Adolf Hitler, after meeting with the rescued former dictator, then put Mussolini in charge of a puppet regime in northern Italy, the Italian Social Republic (Italian: Repubblica Sociale Italiana, RSI), informally known as the Salò Republic, causing a civil war. In late April 1945, in the wake of near total defeat, Mussolini and his mistress Clara Petacci attempted to flee to Switzerland, but both were captured by Italian communist partisans and summarily executed by firing squad on 28 April 1945 near Lake Como. The bodies of Mussolini and his mistress were then taken to Milan, where they were hung upside down at a service station to publicly confirm their demise.<br/>
                <em>Thought 3:</em> Benito Mussolini was assassinated as part of the collapse of the Axis powers during World War II. So the Rome Protocols were signed by three Prime Ministers one of which was assassinated as part of World War II.<br/>

In 1912, he became a member of the National Directorate of the Italian Socialist Party (PSI), but he was expelled from the PSI for advocating military intervention in World War I, in opposition to the party's stance on neutrality. In 1914, Mussolini founded a new journal, Il Popolo d'Italia, and served in the Royal Italian Army during the war until he was wounded and discharged in 1917. Mussolini denounced the PSI, his views now centering on Italian nationalism instead of socialism, and later founded the fascist movement which came to oppose egalitarianism and class conflict, instead advocating "revolutionary nationalism" transcending class lines. On 31 October 1922, following the March on Rome (28–30 October), Mussolini was appointed prime minister by King Victor Emmanuel III, becoming the youngest individual to hold the office up to that time. After removing all political opposition through his secret police and outlawing labor strikes, Mussolini and his followers consolidated power through a series of laws that transformed the nation into a one-party dictatorship. Within five years, Mussolini had established dictatorial authority by both legal and illegal means and aspired to create a totalitarian state. In 1929, Mussolini signed the Lateran Treaty with the Holy See to establish Vatican City.<br/>
                Mussolini's foreign policy aimed to restore the ancient grandeur of the Roman Empire by expanding Italian colonial possessions and the fascist sphere of influence. In the 1920s, he ordered the Pacification of Libya, instructed the bombing of Corfu over an incident with Greece, established a protectorate over Albania, and incorporated the city of Fiume into the Italian state via agreements with Yugoslavia. In 1936, Ethiopia was conquered following the Second Italo-Ethiopian War and merged into Italian East Africa (AOI) with Eritrea and Somalia. In 1939, Italian forces annexed Albania. Between 1936 and 1939, Mussolini ordered the successful Italian military intervention in Spain in favor of Francisco Franco during the Spanish Civil War. Mussolini's Italy initially tried to avoid the outbreak of a second global war, sending troops at the Brenner Pass to delay Anschluss and taking part in the Stresa Front, the Lytton Report, the Treaty of Lausanne, the Four-Power Pact and the Munich Agreement. However, Italy then alienated itself from Britain and France by aligning with Germany and Japan. Germany invaded Poland on 1 September 1939, resulting in declarations of war by France and the UK and the start of World War II.<br/>
                On 10 June 1940, Mussolini decided to enter the war on the Axis side. Despite initial success, the subsequent Axis collapse on multiple fronts and eventual Allied invasion of Sicily made Mussolini lose the support of the population and members of the Fascist Party. As a consequence, early on 25 July 1943, the Grand Council of Fascism passed a motion of no confidence in Mussolini; later that day King Victor Emmanuel III dismissed him as head of government and had him placed in custody, appointing Pietro Badoglio to succeed him as Prime Minister. After the king agreed to an armistice with the Allies, on 12 September 1943 Mussolini was rescued from captivity in the Gran Sasso raid by German paratroopers and Waffen-SS commandos led by Major Otto-Harald Mors. Adolf Hitler, after meeting with the rescued former dictator, then put Mussolini in charge of a puppet regime in northern Italy, the Italian Social Republic (Italian: Repubblica Sociale Italiana, RSI), informally known as the Salò Republic, causing a civil war. In late April 1945, in the wake of near total defeat, Mussolini and his mistress Clara Petacci attempted to flee to Switzerland, but both were captured by Italian communist partisans and summarily executed by firing squad on 28 April 1945 near Lake Como. The bodies of Mussolini and his mistress were then taken to Milan, where they were hung upside down at a service station to publicly confirm their demise.<br/>
                <em>Thought 3:</em> Benito Mussolini was assassinated as part of the collapse of the Axis powers during World War II. So the Rome Protocols were signed by three Prime Ministers one of which was assassinated as part of World War II.<br/>
