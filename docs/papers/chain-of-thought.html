    <div class="description" data-step="0"><em>Summary:</em> This paper explores "Chain-of-Thought prompting", which involves guiding a language model through a series of reasoning steps to solve a problem. This technique proved to significantly enhance the reasoning capabilities of large language models, leading to improved performance in arithmetic, commonsense, and symbolic reasoning tasks. For example, using just eight chain-of-thought prompts, a large language model outperformed even fine-tuned models in a math problem-solving task. However, whether the model is truly "reasoning" remains an open question, and there's no guarantee that the reasoning path is always correct. Also, this method works best with larger models, which can be costly.</div>
    <div class="description" data-step="1">This is a sample question from the <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/openai/grade-school-math">GSM8K dataset</a> which was used to evaluate Chain of Thought prompting on multi-step mathematical reasoning tasks.</div>
    <div class="description" data-step="2">
        <p>The few-shot prompt starts with 8 example question/answer pairs which demonstrate Chain of Thought reasoning. This shows the model how it should format it's answer.</p>
        <p>In the paper they also finetune a model which can do Chain of Thought reasoning without the examples in the prompt and that model gets even better results.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="description" data-step="3">The end of the prompt is the question we want the model to answer followed by "A:" to indicate the start of the answer.</div>
    <div class="description" data-step="4">When the model answers, it uses Chain of Thought reasoning before coming up with the final answer.</div>

She cut each pie into 8 pieces and set the five pies out on the buffet table for the guests to serve themselves. At the end of the evening, after the guests had taken and eaten their pieces of pie, there were 14 pieces of pie remaining. How many pieces were taken by the guests?</div>

                    <em>Q:</em> If there are 3 cars in the parking lot and 2 more cars arrive, how many cars are in the parking lot?<br/>
                    <em>A:</em> There are originally 3 cars. 2 more cars arrive. 3 + 2 = 5. The answer is 5.

                    <em>A:</em> There are 15 trees originally. Then there were 21 trees after some more were planted. So there must have been 21 - 15 = 6. The answer is 6.

                    <em>A:</em> Originally, Leah had 32 chocolates. Her sister had 42. So in total they had 32 + 42 = 74. After eating 35, they had 74 - 35 = 39. The answer is 39.

                    <em>A:</em> Jason started with 20 lollipops. Then he had 12 after giving some to Denny. So he gave Denny 20 - 12 = 8. The answer is 8.
