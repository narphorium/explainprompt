    <div id="controls"></div>
    <div class="description" data-step="0">This is the sample question from the <a target="_blank" href="https://hotpotqa.github.io">HotpotQA dataset</a> which was used to evaluate ReAct prompting on question answering tasks.</div>
    <div class="description" data-step="1">The prompt starts with instructions for the model to follow the Thought, Action, Observation cycle of ReAct prompting, followed by a list of available tools.</div>
    <div class="description tool" data-step="2">Each tool definition shows how to call the tool and describes when that tool should be used. This is how the model decides which tool to use to answer the input question.</div>
    <div class="description" data-step="3">After the tools are defined, there are 6 few-shot examples which show the model example ReAct prompting trajectories being used to answer questions.</div>
    <div class="description" data-step="4">Each example follows the format of a multiple cycles of Thoughts, Actions, and Observations. Each example end with a call to the <span class="tool">Finish[]</span> tool.</div>
    <div class="description" data-step="5">The last part of the prompt is the input question. You can think of this as the start of the 7th few-shot example. This helps makes it easy for the model to continue with the same style of ReAct propting that it has just seen.</div>
    <div class="description" data-step="6">
        <p>Each cycle of ReAct prompting starts with a Thought. These thoughts are similar to <a href="chain-of-thought.html">Chain-of-Thought</a> prompting where the model can flesh out intermediate steps before attempting to give the final answer.</p>
        <p>Here the model recognizes that the question is about the Apple Remote and decides that it should use the <span class="tool">Search</span> tool to get more information about the Apple Remote.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="description tool" data-step="7">The <span class="tool">Search[]</span> tool takes a single text argument and searches Wikipedia for that term. The tool returns the first 5 sentences of text from the first matching result.</div>
    <div class="description tool" data-step="8">Here we can see the Wikipedia description of the <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Remote">Apple Remote</a>.</div>
    <div class="description" data-step="9">In the next cycle of prompting, the outputs from the previous cycle get added to the end of the prompt as a form of short-term memory. This is what enables the model to reflect on the outputs of the previous action and use that information when it decides on the next action to take.</div>
    <div class="description" data-step="10">Here we can see that the model accurately parsed the output from the previous <span class="tool">Search[Apple Remote]</span> action and has used that information to plan it's next action which is to <span class="tool">Search[Front Row]</span></div>
    <div class="description tool" data-step="11">This is the response that the <span class="tool">Search</span> tool returns when there is no exact match on Wikipedia. These are the recommended similar pages as shown in Wikipedia search UI. Having helpful error messages like this are what allows ReAct prompting to recover from errors and explore alternative solutions.</div>
    <div class="description" data-step="12">Here we can see that the model has parsed the error message and decided to attempt <span class="tool">Search[Front Row (software)]</span> instead. Notice that this was not the top recommendation that Wikipedia Search returned but the model was able to pick the correct recommendation by using the conversation history in the prompt to infer that the software company is the right choice.</div>
    <div class="description tool" data-step="13">Here are the first 5 sentences from the <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Front_Row_(software)">Front Row (software)</a> Wikipedia page.</div>
    <div class="description" data-step="14">The model is able to accurately parse the description of "Front Row (software)" and infer that the answer to the original input question is "keyboard function keys".</div>
    <div class="description tool" data-step="15">To end the ReAct prompting loop, the model calls the <span class="tool">Finish[keyboard function keys]</span> tool. This also provides a nice way of capturing the final answer in a concise form which can be matched against the expected answer from the evaluation dataset without having to parse it out of the full-sentence answer in the previous thought.</div>

                        <em>Action 1:</em> <span class="tool">Search[Colorado orogeny]</span><br/>
                        <em>Observation 1:</em> The Colorado orogeny was an episode of mountain building (an orogeny) in Colorado and surrounding areas.<br/>
                        <em>Thought 2:</em> It does not mention the eastern sector. So I need to look up eastern sector.<br/>
                        <em>Action 2:</em> <span class="tool">Lookup[eastern sector]</span><br/>
                        <em>Observation 2:</em> (Result 1 / 1) The eastern sector extends into the High Plains and is called the Central Plains orogeny.<br/>
                        <em>Thought 3:</em> The eastern sector of Colorado orogeny extends into the High Plains. So I need to search High Plains and find its elevation range.<br/>
                        <em>Action 3:</em> <span class="tool">Search[High Plains]</span><br/>
                        <em>Observation 3:</em> High Plains refers to one of two distinct land regions<br/>
                        <em>Thought 4:</em> I need to instead search High Plains (United States).<br/>
                        <em>Action 4:</em> <span class="tool">Search[High Plains (United States)]</span><br/>
                        <em>Observation 4:</em> The High Plains are a subregion of the Great Plains. From east to west, the High Plains rise in elevation from around 1,800 to 7,000 ft (550 to 2,130 m).[3]<br/>
                        <em>Thought 5:</em>  High Plains rise in elevation from around 1,800 to 7,000 ft, so the answer is 1,800 to 7,000 ft.<br/>

                        <em>Thought 1:</em> The question simplifies to "The Simpsons" character Milhouse is named after who. I only need to search Milhouse and find who it is named after.<br/>
                        <em>Action 1:</em> <span class="tool">Search[Milhouse]</span><br/>
                        <em>Observation 1:</em> Milhouse Mussolini Van Houten is a recurring character in the Fox animated television series The Simpsons voiced by Pamela Hayden and created by Matt Groening.<br/>
                        <em>Thought 2:</em> The paragraph does not tell who Milhouse is named after, maybe I can look up "named after".<br/>

                        <em>Observation 2:</em> (Result 1 / 1) Milhouse was named after U.S. president Richard Nixon, whose middle name was Milhous.<br/>
                        <em>Thought 3:</em> Milhouse was named after U.S. president Richard Nixon, so the answer is Richard Nixon.<br/>

                        <em>Action 1:</em> <span class="tool">Search[Adam Clayton Powell]</span><br/>
                        <em>Observation 1:</em> Could not find [Adam Clayton Powell].

                        <em>Thought 2:</em> To find the documentary, I can search Adam Clayton Powell (film).<br/>
                        <em>Action 2:</em> <span class="tool">Search[Adam Clayton Powell (film)]</span><br/>
                        <em>Observation 2:</em> Adam Clayton Powell is a 1989 American documentary film directed by Richard Kilberg. The film is about the rise and fall of influential African-American politician Adam Clayton Powell Jr.[3][4] It was later aired as part of the PBS series The American Experience.<br/>
                        <em>Thought 3:</em> Adam Clayton Powell (film) is a documentary about an African-American politician, not Finnish rock groups. So the documentary about Finnish rock groups must instead be The Saimaa Gesture.<br/>
