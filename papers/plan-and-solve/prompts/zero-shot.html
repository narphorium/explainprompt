                <em>Q:</em> Jesse’s rooms are 19 feet long and 18 feet wide. If she has 20 rooms in all. How much carpet does she need to cover the floors of all rooms?<br/>
                <em>A:</em> Let’s first understand the problem, extract relevant variables and their corresponding numerals, and make and device a complete plan.Then, let’s carry out the plan, calculate intermediate variables (pay attention to correct numerical calculation and commonsense), solve the problem step by step, and show the answer.

                <em>Relevant Variables:</em><br/>
                Number of rooms: 20<br/>
                Length of each room: 19 feet<br/>
                Width of each room: 18 feet<br/>
                <em>Plan:</em><br/>
                Step 1: Calculate the area of each room.<br/>
                Step 2: Multiply the area of each room by the number of rooms.<br/>
                Step 3: Show the answer.<br/>
                <em>Calculation:</em><br/>
                Step 1: Area of each room = Length x Width = 19 feet x 18 feet = 342 square feet<br/>
                Step 2: Total area of all rooms = Area of each room x Number of rooms = 342 square feet x 20 rooms = 6840 square feet<br/>
                <em>Answer:</em> Jesse needs 6840 square feet of carpet to cover the floors of all rooms.</div><br/>
