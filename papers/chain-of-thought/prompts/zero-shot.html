            <div class="answer"><em>A:</em> Let’s think step by step. The spaceship traveled 0.5 light-years from Earth to Planet X. Then it traveled 0.1 light-years from Planet X to Planet Y. Finally, it traveled 0.1 light-years from Planet Y back to Earth. So the total distance the spaceship traveled is 0.5 + 0.1 + 0.1 = 0.7 light-years. Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is: 0.7 light-years</div>
